    "   \n",
    "   For the titanic dataset, it makes sense that women would be saved first, as that is what was said to have happeneed. For covid, the comorbidities generated by our rules seem to be related to various health conditions that might play out as factors in survival. For example, not having hypertension almost immediately means you do not need to worry about dying.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Additional research that needs to happen would, unfortunately, be randomly controlled trials where we give people with various conditions covid in order to find the risk ratios for those conditions. This is unethical, and should never happen, however. Barring that, more publically available data is needed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Regarding the rules I have above, I could not get the algorithm to generate more than 7 rules for the dataset for covid. I wonder if there is a bug in my code, but it appears to work for the test case from the notes, and it yields correct results for the ones it gives. In any case, it works *very* fast. It took mere seconds to find the rules it did in fact find."
